# Mouse Control with Playing Cards

The main idea of this project is controling files and folders using webcam. For performance we need to use a darkish blue item. The most important terms are use the webcam with appropriate technical specifications. 

**Where** it can be used? For example: in constructing hardwares, on various seminars to make the presentation more interesting, in 3D modeling to make it more natural, attractive and faster and to feel the third dimension, in airports to automatize the airplane parking and etc.

And **how does this work**. OpenCV was used to create such an effect. The app is tracking only blue objects. Once the objects are found the are linked with a line and the middle point of this line is marked with a red circle. Imagine that circle is your mouse. But someone can exclaim: *"Hey! The middle of binding is inside the camera window! It cannot just work correct for whole display"*. Don't worry! We can use the ratio rule to make camera mouse work correct display. It's a bit difficult to get used to the system but once do you'll enjoy! And we are done.
